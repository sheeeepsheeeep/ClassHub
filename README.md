# ClassHub - Sprint 1 Report

Tasks Completed: 
Assigning roles, setting up the GitHub repository, and writing sprint planning notes. We defined user stories, created the system architecture and product backlog, set up the database, planned the branching strategy, designed the homepage and login UI, and made the booking flow diagram. 

Adjustments: some tasks were rescheduled to Sprint 2 to balance the workload and time allocations. 

Reflection: There were some misunderstandings in the beginning, but they were resolved quickly through team discussions. Overall, a solid start, with important tasks completed successfully
