# ClassHub - Sprint 3 Report

Tasks Completed: 
We created the booking history and admin management pages, added error handling, fixed interface issues, completed the final branch strategy, conducted full system testing, finalized the presentation slides, and documented the Sprint 3 planning notes. 

Adjustments: several interface elements required changes due to usability issues that were found during the testing phase. Slight changes were also made to the booking logic to improve clarity. 

Reflection: With most core features completed earlier, we focused on refining the system and ensuring everything worked as expected, and the team collaborated well to finalize the project.
