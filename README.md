# ClassHub - Sprint 2 Report

Tasks Completed: 
In Sprint 2, the team focused on building the main features of the system. The About Us and Classrooms pages were created, and the booking request form was developed and connected to the database with input validation. The admin panel features were implemented, including the interface design and booking approval functionality. The second iteration of the branching strategy was also applied, and Sprint 2 planning notes were documented. 

Adjustments: the interface design took longer than expected due to refinements and to connect to the backend and the due date was to be rescheduled and changes were made to task distribution to balance the workload. 

Reflection: Significant progress was made in the systemâ€™s development and collaboration among team members was more effective. All planned tasks were completed within the sprint duration and successfully implemented the important components to the classroom management system.
